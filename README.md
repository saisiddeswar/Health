# Health
This project is a health monitoring and diet planning website built using React for the frontend and Node.js with MongoDB Atlas for the backend. It allows users to plan personalized diets, track daily calorie intake, and maintain streaks for consistency in their health journey. The platform features secure user authentication using JWT, a responsive UI, and a seamless database integration with MongoDB Atlas. Users can log their food intake, monitor nutritional values, and receive insights to stay on track with their fitness goals. The system ensures data security and efficient tracking, enabling users to lead a healthier lifestyle. Future enhancements may include AI-powered diet recommendations and wearable device integration for more accurate health tracking.
